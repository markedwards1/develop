# Code Refactor Challenge 1

## Refactoring Horison webpage

Provided with messy code, I was asked to view sorce code which was made up of div tags, The source code had illogical structure in both the HTML and CSS files. I was also directed to apply accessability standards so that the site was optimised for search engines. 

I changed element names to give the DOM a logical structure, relocated CSS rules, consolidated duplicate CSS rules, applied attributes to images for accessability, compressed images for easier download, and added a title.



- My motivation was to provide a quicker, more accessable website. It was also to provide a logical flow so that any person viewing the code could quickly and easily comprehend. 
- This project was built to simplify code, and provide accessibility. 
- This project solved messy code, readibility, and page load times. It also provided accessability.
- I learned while working on this code that if you use better element logic, CSS classes your work will be neater and tell a better story for the next user. I also learnt about accessability when it relates to attributes, and ordered lists.
